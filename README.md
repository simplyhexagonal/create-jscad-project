# Create JSCAD Project

## Introduction

An NPX starter template designed to kickstart your JSCAD projects using TypeScript and Hot Reload preview. This tool simplifies the process of setting up a JSCAD project, allowing you to focus on creating fully parametric CAD drawings with ease.

## Features

- üöÄ **Easy Setup**: Initialize your JSCAD project with a single command.
- üíª **TypeScript Support**: Leverage the power of TypeScript for more robust code.
- üîÅ **Hot Reload Preview**: Instantly view changes in your CAD design as you code.
- üîß **Automatic Interactive Controls**: If you define parameters in your design, the viewport will render interactive controls that can be changed in the UI.
- üìÅ **Automated Structure and Dependency Management**: Automatically creates the necessary folder structure and installs dependencies.
- üé® **Focus on Design**: Spend more time designing and less on setup.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Integrated VSCode Experience**: Recommended extensions and launch configurations for a seamless development experience.
- üì§ **Advanced Export Options**: Export your designs to X3D, 3MF, and SVG formats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to use `npm` or `npx`.

### Installation

To create a new JSCAD project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm init jscad-project <your-project-name>
```

or

```bash
npx create-jscad-project <your-project-name>
```

This command will create a new directory with your project name, set up the folder structure, and install all the necessary dependencies.

### Templates

To use a specific template, pass the `--template` argument when creating a new project. For example:

```bash
npm init jscad-project <your-project-name> -- --template=screw-and-nut
```

To list available templates you can run:

```bash
npx create-jscad-project --list-templates
```

There are currently two templates available:

- `default`: A blank canvas for whatever project you're working on.
- `screw-and-nut`: Contains a screw and nut for you to play with.

More templates will be added soon, hopefully by contributors too!

### VSCode Integration

- **Recommended Extensions**: The generated `.vscode` directory contains recommendations for helpful extensions. Please review and install them to enhance your development experience.
- **Launch Configuration**: Use the "Launch JSCAD" configuration in the `Run and Debug` section of VSCode. This will open the `drawing.ts` file, run `npm run dev`, and open the preview browser. 
  - **Note**: The first time you run this, the preview browser may initially display a white screen. Please wait until the debug output indicates that it's safe to reload the simple browser panel.

### Alternatively - Development in other IDEs

If you are **NOT** using VSCode, or if you'd rather run the dev environment manually, then, after setting up your project, navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm run dev
```

### Preview and Export

- In the preview window, you have the option to export your designs to X3D and 3MF file formats.
- To export to SVG, project any parts into 2D and ensure the "Projection" checkbox is turned on.
