# JSCad Project

## Introduction

This project was created using [create-jscad-project](https://github.com/simplyhexagonal/create-jscad-project).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### VSCode Integration

- **Recommended Extensions**: The generated `.vscode` directory contains recommendations for helpful extensions. Please review and install them to enhance your development experience.
- **Launch Configuration**: Use the "Launch JsCad" configuration in the `Run and Debug` section of VSCode. This will open the `drawing.ts` file, run `npm run dev`, and open the preview browser. 
  - **Note**: The first time you run this, the preview browser may initially display a white screen. Please wait until the debug output indicates that it's safe to reload the simple browser panel.

### Alternatively - Development in other IDEs

If you are **NOT** using VSCode, or if you'd rather run the dev environment manually, then, after setting up your project, navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm run dev
```
